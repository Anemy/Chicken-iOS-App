Chicken the iOS App
==============

People have played Venmo chicken for ages. We made it official. The game starts by sending a friend $1. Your friend has the option to send it back, keep it, or better yet â€“ double up!

Doubling up means your friend sends you back $2. Then it's your turn. Will you send back $4? Keep their $2? How much money are you willing to risk on a game of chicken!?

Created for iOS using Venmo's money transferring service (API)
